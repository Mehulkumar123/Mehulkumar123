## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub, where I’m tripping over code like a caffeinated penguin on roller skates! 🐧⛸️ I’m a beginner programmer, and my repos are a glorious mess of “why isn’t this working?” and “OH SNAP, IT WORKED!” moments. Think of me as a coding toddler—making chaos, learning stuff, and occasionally throwing a tantrum when my semicolons betray me. 😭

### Fun Facts

- **Favorite Bug**: When my code decides to yeet itself into the void for no reason. *Poof!* Gone. 🪄
- **Coding Fuel**: Mountain Dew, pizza rolls, and panic-Googling at 3 a.m. 🍕⚡️
- **Superpower**: Writing 50 lines of code to do something a single Stack Overflow answer could’ve fixed. 🦸‍♂️
- **Dream Project**: A game where you fight a dragon made of my own typos. *“Missing colon at line 42!”* 🐉

## What I'm Learning

- **HTML/CSS**: Building websites that look like they escaped from a 90s Geocities fever dream. 🌈
- **JavaScript**: Making buttons *kinda* work while summoning a swarm of console errors. 🐝
- **Python**: Charming snakes and accidentally turning my laptop into a toaster. 🐍🔥
- **Git**: My commit messages? “Help,” “I hate this,” and “Fixed it, I think?” 😅

## My Repos

My repositories are like a haunted amusement park—thrilling, a little broken, and nobody’s sure what’s going on:

- **Project 1**: A to-do list app that forgets your tasks faster than I forget CSS properties. 📝
- **Project 2**: A calculator that crashes if you look at it funny. Math is my nemesis. 🧮💥
- **Project 3**: A “work in progress” that’s been chilling since I binged *Stranger Things*. 🕸️

## Why I Code

Coding is like solving a puzzle while riding a unicycle and juggling flaming torches. 🔥🤡 It’s frustrating, exhilarating, and I’m 99% sure I’m doing it wrong—but when it works, I feel like I just high-fived a wizard. 🧙‍♂️ I’m here to learn, laugh at my bugs, and maybe convince other newbies that we’re all just winging it.
