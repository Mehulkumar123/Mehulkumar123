<h3>👨‍💻</h3
My name is Mehul, and I'm a 16-year-old Python coder from India. I've been passionate about coding since middle school and have been constantly exploring different programming languages and building my skills. I find coding to be a lot of fun, and I enjoy being able to create something new from scratch. I've worked on a few small projects in Python, like creating a calculator and a guessing game. I'm still learning the basics of the language, but I'm looking forward to exploring it further. Aside from coding, I enjoy staring screen and reading. I'm hoping to continue my education in computer science and eventually pursue a career in tech. Overall, I'm excited about the possibilities that Python offers and I'm looking forward to continuing my coding journey.
