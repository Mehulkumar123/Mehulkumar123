# Mehul Kumar

Hi there! My name is Mehul, and I'm a 16-year-old Python coder from India. I've been passionate about coding since middle school, and I'm constantly exploring different programming languages to build my skills. I find coding to be a lot of fun, and I enjoy being able to create something new from scratch. So far, I've worked on a few small projects in Python, including a calculator and a guessing game. Although I'm still learning the basics of the language, I'm looking forward to exploring it further and creating more complex projects. Outside of coding, I also enjoy staring at screens and reading. In the future, pursue a career in tech. Overall, I'm excited about the possibilities that Python offers, and I can't wait to continue my coding journey.
